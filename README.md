# Splunk-Web-Intrusion-Report

## OBJECTIVE
To investigate a suspected web server compromise affecting crestwaybank.com, using Splunk log analysis to identify the attacker's initial access vector. This project involves querying the crestway-web index to reconstruct the intrusion timeline, uncover attacker behavior, and extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) from the web server logs.

## SKILLS LEARNED
- Authored a detailed 7-page incident response report documenting each investigation phase, supported by screenshots, evidence, and figure summaries.
- Extracted a comprehensive set of IOCs including IP addresses, file paths, vulnerable endpoints, plugin names, decoded commands, and attacker tools (WPScan, Netcat).
- Used Splunkâ€™s Search Processing Language (SPL) to investigate web server logs from the crestway-web index, filtering relevant events.
- Detected brute-force login attempts via xmlrpc.php, suspicious POST requests, and reverse shell payloads by writing targeted SPL queries across access logs and HTTP request data.
- Analyzed shifts in User-Agent strings (from WPScan to Firefox) to distinguish between automated scanning and manual attacker interaction post-compromise.
- Detected a Netcat-based reverse shell encoded in a URL query string and decoded the payload using CyberChef to confirm outbound command-and-control (C2) communication.
